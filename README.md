Traer Physics Engine for Objective-C
====================================

<https://github.com/chrismiles/CMTraerPhysics>

CMTraerPhysics is a port of the Traer v3.0 physics engine
to Objective-C/Cocoa by Chris Miles.

Traer Physics is a particle system and spring physics simulator.
The library handles the physics simulation only, it is up to the
user to implement any graphical output.

The Traer physics engine was originally created by Jeffrey
Traer Bernstein <http://murderandcreate.com/physics/>

Parts of this project were ported from traerAS3 by Arnaud Icard
<https://github.com/sqrtof5/traerAS3>

CMTraerPhysics is open source, released under an MIT license.

A demo iOS application is included, containing example implementations
in both OpenGL ES and Core Animation. The demo app is open source and
released under an MIT license.
